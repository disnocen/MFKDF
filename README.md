The Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function (MFKDF) is a function that takes multiple inputs and outputs a string of bytes that can be used as a cryptographic key. It serves the same purpose as a pasword-based key derivation function (PBKDF), but is stronger than password-based key derivation due to its support for multiple authentication factors. MFKDF also supports account recovery via K-of-N (secret-sharing style) key derivation.
